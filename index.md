## Welcome to Xiang 'Dynasty' Li's HomePage!

Hello, my name is Xiang Li, a Year 2 student at the [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) in China. My major is Information and Computing Science (also with a Computer Science bachelor degree from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in UK). I am also an IEEE Student Member. You can find me in my [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiang_Li31/). 

Honestly, my GPA is a bit lower than my classmates in our Univ. In addition to my research projects and the research projects I participated in, I am now sorting out several materials for Algorithms and Data Structures (in Java) and you will see these open srouces in my github later.

For more details about me, just wait for the further update OR  <a href="mailto:dynasty.li@outlook.com?subject=Write Your Question or Requirement+Your (Nick)Name">email</a> me to ask for my latest academic curriculum vitae.


## Research Interests

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with subfields in Extended Reality, Game Experience, and Novel Interaction Techniques. Meanwhile, I am also interested in the Sociological Application of Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing). 

I am actively looking for some friends <font color="red">who have the same research interests in HCI and a strong background in Python and Deep Learning.</font> If you are interested in working with me, <a href="mailto:dynasty.li@outlook.com?subject=Co-operation in HCI and Deep Learning + Your (Nick)Name">email</a> me for more information!<br />


## Academic Experience

I am now working in the [X-CHI Lab] of our university under the supervision of the Dean of our department [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/hai-liang/) and [Dr. Wenge Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenge_Xu/), with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Game Tech (Exergames) and Users' Interaction Experience. `Honest thanks to Wenger.` 

I will also join the [Exertion Games Lab](https://exertiongameslab.org/) of the [University of Monash](https://www.monash.edu/) this summer as a three-month intern from the end of June to the early September, with a focus on Brain-Computer Interaction and Motor Memory. [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller](http://floydmueller.com/home/home.htm/) will be my 'boss' of this intern . He is the **General Co-Chair** of CHI 2020, which is the TOP 1 academic conference in the field of the Human-Computer Interaction. Meanwhile, I will work with Dr. Rakesh Patibanda and Dr. Nathan Semertzidis at the Exertion Games Lab. **My Pleasure!**.

Due to the spread of new coronavirus and nowadays serious public health situation around the world, I have to cancel the planned visit to the [University of British Columbia](https://ok.ubc.ca/). It was supposed to take place in June. I hope the [Prof. Khalad Hasan](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/) can understand meüò≠, **I didn't mean to üê¶üê¶üê¶(Breach of Plan)**.

## Career

My long-term goal is to apply HCI-related knowledge into the real society, and let people can really enjoy the benefits from the growth and breakthrough of technology instead of letting cutting-edge research stay in the papers‚Äô databases and top conferences. I will focus on solving more realistic problems in the area of human-computer interaction with healthcare and users' experience.

For my short goal, ~~I have to graduate alive from XJTLU first.~~ I hope to have the opportunity to participate in the research projects of the world's top HCI academic institutions as a visiting research assistant or a PhD candidate.

## Life

```markdown
Here I will write down a few words to record some important/interesting events.

1. `Wuhan!` üá®üá≥!

2. One Paper is Finally Accepted by `IEEE VR`! It's also my `first` academic paper!

3. Travelled in `UAEüá¶üá™ (Dubai & Abu Dhabi)`, `Tunisiaüáπüá≥ (almost the whole country)` and `Moroccoüá≤üá¶ (almost the whole country)` this Winter Vacation!

4. üò≠No visa to US, so I won't make it to Atlanta. What a pity! I will do the remote presentation instead!
