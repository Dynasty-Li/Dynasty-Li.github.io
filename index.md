## Welcome to the Xiang 'Dynasty' Li's HomePage!

Hello, my name is Xiang Li, a Year 2 student at the [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) in China. My major is Information and Computing Science (also with a Computer Science bachelor degree from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in UK). I am also an IEEE Student Member. You can also find me in the ResearchGate [Xiang Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiang_Li31/). 

For more details about me, just wait for the further update OR  <a href="mailto:dynasty.li@outlook.com?subject=Write Your Question or Requirement+Your (Nick)Name">email</a> me to ask for my latest academic curriculum vitae.

## Research

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction and Sociological Application of Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing).

## Academic Experience

I am now working in the [X-CHI Lab] of our university under the supervision of the Dean of our department [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/hai-liang/) and [Dr. Wenge Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenge_Xu/), with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Game Tech and Exergames. Honest thanks to Wenger, and my first research paper is accepted by the **IEEE VR. Good Job!**

I will also join the [Exertion Games Lab](https://exertiongameslab.org/) at the [University of Monash](https://www.monash.edu/) this summer as a three-month intern from the end of June to early September, with a focus on Brain-Computer Interaction and Motor Memory. [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller](http://floydmueller.com/home/home.htm/) will be my intern 'boss'. He is the **General Co-Chair** of CHI 2020, which is the TOP 1 academic conference in the field of the Human-Computer Interaction. **My pleasure anyway**.

Due to the spread of new coronavirus and nowadays serious public health situation in China, I have to cancel the planned visit to the [University of British Columbia](https://ok.ubc.ca/). It would be the whole June. I hope the [Prof. Khalad Hasan](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/mkhasan/) can understand meüò≠, **I didn't mean to üê¶üê¶üê¶**.
