<h2 id="Academic-Experience">Academic Experience</h2>

I am working at the [X-CHI Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Hai-Ning-Liangs-X-CHI-Lab-Hai-Ning-Liang) of [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant under the supervision of the Head of our department [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/hai-liang/) and [Dr. Wenge Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenge_Xu/) since 2019 summer, with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Exergames, and User Experience. 

I also work at the [Exertion Games Lab](https://exertiongameslab.org/) of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) as a research assistant, lying primarily in the field of electrical muscle stimulation and muscle interfaces (Embodied Memory Support). [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller](http://floydmueller.com/) and [Rakesh Patibanda](https://rakeshpatibanda.com) (Ph.D.) are my advisors of this intern.

<h2 id="Research-Interests">Research Interests</h2>

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction with subfields in Extended Reality (AR/VR/MR), Game Experience, and Responsive/Interactive Environments. My research focuses on the subjective reality of living in a responsive environment with extended reality devices. In addition, I am interested in analyzing user behavior from physical feedback, as well as subjective user perceptions through questionnaires and interviews. I conduct systematic research and analysis of user habits in real life and virtual and design corresponding software/games in real/augmented reality environments to provide and demonstrate the implications and applications of user-habit research, which I call "Habit-Computer Interaction".
