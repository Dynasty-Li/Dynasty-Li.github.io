Hello, my name is Xiang Li, a Year 3 student from the [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) in China. My major is Information and Computing Science (also with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in the UK). I am also an IEEE Student Member.

For more details about me, please read my website and my [CV/Resume](/papers/CV.pdf). My Twitter: [@XiangLi0929](https://twitter.com/XiangLi0929). 

<h2 id="Research-Interests">Research Interests</h2>

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with subfields in Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR), Game Experience, and Interactive Techniques.

My research will focus on the subjective reality of living in an augmented environment and extended reality devices from a human factors design perspective. In addition, I will focus on analyzing user behavior from physical feedback, as well as subjective user perceptions, through questionnaires and interviews. I will conduct systematic research and analysis of user habits in real life and virtual and design corresponding software/games in real/augmented reality environments to provide and demonstrate the implications and applications of user habit research.

<h2 id="Academic-Experience">Academic Experience</h2>

I have been working in the [X-CHI Lab] of [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) as a research assistant under the supervision of the Head of our department [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/hai-liang/) and [Dr. Wenge Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenge_Xu/) since 2019 summer, with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Game Tech (Exergames) and Users' Interaction Experience. 

I also worked at the [Exertion Games Lab](https://exertiongameslab.org/) of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) as a research assistant, lying primarily in the fields of Leveraging Electrical Muscle Stimulation as an Embodied Memory Support Device. [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller](http://floydmueller.com/), [Prof. Elise van den Hoven](http://elisevandenhoven.com/), and [Rakesh Patibanda](https://rakeshpatibanda.com) (Ph.D.) are my advisors of this intern. 

<img src="/logo.png" width="50%">

I served as a reviewer for IMWUT (Ubicomp 2020), ISMAR 2020, VRST 2020, CHI PLAY 2020, IEEE TVCG (IEEE VR 2021 Journal-track) and CHI 2021, and I got 2x Special Recognitions for Outstanding Reviews for ISMAR 2020.

<h2 id="Publications">Selected Publications</h2>

**Note**: ACM CHI, ACM SIGGRAPH (& Asia), IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR, ACM UIST, and ACM CHI PLAY are generally recognized as top-tier conferences in my field of Human-Computer Interaction, Game Technology, Interaction Design, and Virtual/Augmented Reality.
