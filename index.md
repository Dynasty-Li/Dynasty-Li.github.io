## Welcome to the Xiang 'Dynasty' Li's HomePage!

Hello, my name is Xiang Li, a Year 2 student at the Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity in China. My major is Information and Computing Science (also with a Computer Science bachelor degree from the University of Liverpool in UK).

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction and Sociological Application of Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing).

I am now working at the [X-CHI Lab] at our university under the supervision of [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang] and [Dr. Wenge Xu], with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Game Tech and Exergames. Honest thanks to Wenger.

I will also join the [Exertion Games Lab] at the [University of Monash] this summer as a three-month intern from the end of June to early September, with a focus on Brain-Computer Interaction and Motor Memory. [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller] will be my intern 'boss'. He is the General Co-Chair of CHI 2020, which is the TOP 1 academic conference in the field of the Human-Computer Interaction. My pleasure anyway.

For more details about me, just wait for the further update OR email me (dynasty[dot]li[at]outlook[dot]com) to ask for my academic CV.
