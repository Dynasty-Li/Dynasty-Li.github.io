Hello, my name is Xiang Li, a Year 2 student from the [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univiersity](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) in China. My major is Information and Computing Science (also with a bachelor degree in Computer Science from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in UK). I am also an IEEE Student Member.

In addition to my research projects and the research projects I participated in, I am now sorting out several materials for Algorithms and Data Structures (in Java) and you will see these open-source study materials in my github later (perhaps in early 2022).

For more details about me, just wait for the further update or <a href="mailto:dynasty.li@outlook.com?subject=Write Your Question or Requirement+Your Name">email</a> me to ask for my latest academic curriculum vitae.


## Research Interests

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with subfields in Extended Reality, Game Experience, and Novel Interaction Techniques. Meanwhile, I am also interested in the Sociological Application of Artificial Intelligence (i.e., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing). 

I am highly interested in publishing the academic research projects to the top conferences of Human-Computer Interaction field, such as CHI, CHI Play, SIGGRAPH (& Asia), UIST, IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR and so on.

## Academic Experience

I am now working in the [X-CHI Lab] of our university under the supervision of the Dean of our department [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/staff/hai-liang/) and [Dr. Wenge Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenge_Xu/), with a focus on Virtual and Augmented Reality, Game Tech (Exergames) and Users' Interaction Experience. `Honest thanks to Wenger and Hai-Ning.` 

I will also join the [Exertion Games Lab](https://exertiongameslab.org/) of [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) this summer as a three-month intern from the June to this September, with a focus on Brain-Computer Interaction and Motor Memory. [Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller](http://floydmueller.com/home/home.htm/) will be my advisor of this intern. He is the **General co-Chair of the _CHI 2020_**, which is the **Top 1** academic conference in the field of the Human-Computer Interaction. Meanwhile, I will work with Rakesh Patibanda at the Exertion Games Lab. **My Pleasure!**.

## Goals

My long-term goal is to apply HCI-related knowledge into the real society, and let people can really enjoy the benefits from the growth and breakthrough of technology instead of letting cutting-edge research stay in the papers’ databases and top conferences. I will focus on solving more realistic problems in the area of human-computer interaction with healthcare and users' experience.

For my short-term goal, ~~I have to graduate alive from XJTLU first.~~ I hope to have the opportunity to participate in the research projects of the world's top HCI academic institutions as a visiting research assistant or a PhD candidate. 

## Publications

**Note**: ACM CHI, ACM SIGGRAPH (& Asia), IEEE VR, IEEE ISMAR, ACM UIST, and ACM CHI PLAY are generally recognized as top-tier conferences in my field of Human-Computer Interaction, Game Technology, Interaction Design and Virtual/Augmented Reality.
